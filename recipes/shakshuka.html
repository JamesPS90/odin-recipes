    <h3>Shakshuka may be at the apex of eggs-for-dinner 
        recipes, though in Israel it is breakfast food, 
        a bright, spicy start to the day with a pile of 
        pita or challah served on the side. (It also 
        makes excellent brunch or lunch food.)</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 large bell pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cayenne</li>
        <li>1 can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black peppper</li>
        <li>5 ounces feta</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 375 degrees. Heat oil in a 
            large skillet over medium-low. Add onion 
            and bell pepper. Cook gently until very 
            soft, about 20 minutes. Add garlic and 
            cook until tender, 1 to 2 minutes; stir 
            in cumin, paprika and cayenne, and cook 
            1 minute. Pour in tomatoes and season 
            with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon 
            pepper; simmer until tomatoes have 
            thickened, about 10 minutes. Taste and 
            add more salt and pepper if needed. 
            Stir in crumbled feta.</li>
        <li>Gently crack eggs into skillet over tomatoes.
             Season eggs with salt and pepper. Transfer 
             skillet to oven and bake until eggs are just 
             set, 7 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro 
             and serve with hot sauce.</li>
