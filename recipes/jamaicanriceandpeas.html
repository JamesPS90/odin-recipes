        popular side dish and I am excited to share 
        the recipe with you. Rice, red kidney beans
        (peas), fresh coconut milk and season to 
        perfection</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried kidney beans</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 scallions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>5 allspice berries</li>
        <li>5 thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>13.5 ounce unsweetened coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 cups long grain Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan, cover the beans with 
            the water and bring to a boil over moderately 
            high heat. Stir in the onion, scallions, 
            garlic, allspice, thyme, Scotch bonnet, 
            ginger, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon 
            pepper. Stir in the coconut milk and bring 
            to a simmer. Cover and simmer over low heat 
            until beans are tender, about 1 hour; adjust
             the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle 
             simmer.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice, cover and simmer over 
                 low heat until the rice is tender and 
                 the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. 
                 Remove from the heat and let steam for 
                 10 minutes, then discard the thyme stems, 
                 allspice berries and Scotch bonnet. 
                 Using a fork, fluff the rice and beans 
                 and season with salt. Serve hot.</li>
