    <h3>This Cheesy Pasta Bake With Chicken And Bacon is a family favourite (and it makes great leftovers too!).
        Not a lot can beat a lovely cheesy pasta bake served up with a big side of salad (obviously that makes it healthy.......)</h4>

        <li>400 g dried pasta shapes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large chicken breasts</li>    
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>pinch of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of dried thyme</li>
        <li>800g tinned chopped tomatos</li>

        <li>100g strong chedder cheese</li>
        <li>100g mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190c/375f. 
            Boil a large pan of water and cook 
            the pasta for 1 minute less than
             recommended on the pack. Drain.</li>
        <li>Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat 
            the oil on a medium heat, in a large 
            frying pan. Add the chicken, and cook 
            until just sealed - about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and cook for a further 
            3-4 minutes until the onion is softened.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped peppers, salt, pepper, 
            garlic, tomato puree, oregano and thyme. 
            Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tinned tomatoes and cream, 
            bring to a gentle bubble, then add the 
            pasta, spinach and cooked bacon. Stir 
            everything together, then transfer to a 
            large baking dish</li>
        <li>Top with the cheddar and mozzarella, 
            and place in the oven for 20-25 minutes, 
            until the cheese is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Take out of the oven and top with parsley 
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
